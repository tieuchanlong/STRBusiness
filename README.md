## Description
This project is an extensive version of the itch.io Weekly Game Jam 139 entry. The game is a fast-paced money-collecting game where you have to interact with NPCS, steal their money and escape from them. As a reminder, you also have to escape from the busy streets and not get hit by any vehicle to continue.
